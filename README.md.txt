## Output

This document need to be restructured. 
It should be possible to link all the files together to get an ouput document, probably in html format.
That final document could then be published somewhere.

Accompanying the document could be a bunch of notebooks (both R and python) illustrating the concepts.
The notebooks are important but are separate from the document.


### What should be the **format**?

Latex, markdown, asciidoc

It obviously need to be able to render mathematics: equations, greek symbols, vector, matrices, categorical diagrams.

Nice if the different chapters can be in different folders.

Support from some sort of collapsing (for long proofs).
Another solution is to move long proofs to annex.

What is the **logical organization**?
Should it be like a wiki, like a book?
See examples: stacks project, [wiki for physics concepts](https://physicstravelguide.com/), 
[group wiki](https://groupprops.subwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page),
[wikiversity group theory](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Group_theory)

In the stacks project they use one file per chapter and no folder structure.
Each file is very long. They use lots of blank spaces to deliminate the structure.

I think it should be public early, as that is a strong motivation.

Use gitlab wiki? I like the wiki format.
Asciidoc looks good. But markdown looks more mature.


For example right now I am interested in representation theory of 1D galilean group, SO(1) and SO(1, 1).
I should have a few background papers explaining how I get to those representations.
Then the "meat" of the presentation should be a notebook or some programming stuff.
For example for the representations of SO(1) on 2nd degree homogeneous polynomials, I could plot them?

## Goal

It is about group theory and its applications.
There are many many such texts already.
I'm doing it so that I can get better intuition and knowledge of group theory.
I emphasize practical examples using programming.
