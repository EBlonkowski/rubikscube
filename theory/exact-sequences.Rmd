# General

**Definition** Let N, Q, G be 3 groups, we say that the sequence 
$$ 0 \rightarrow N \rightarrow^i G \rightarrow^{\pi} Q \rightarrow 0 $$


is exact iff

1. i and $\pi$ are homomorphism
2. i is injective and $\pi$ is surjective
3. $\mathrm{Ker}(\pi) = \mathrm{Im}(i)$

**Property** if $0 \rightarrow N \rightarrow^i G \rightarrow^{\pi} Q \rightarrow 0$ is exact then

1. $\mathrm{Im}(i)$ is a normal subgroup of G isomorphic to N.
2. Q is isomorphic to G/N

## Sequence splitting


**Definition** We say that the exact sequence $0 \rightarrow N \rightarrow^i G \rightarrow^{\pi} Q \rightarrow 0$ is **left split** if there is a homorphism $j: G \rightarrow N$ such that $j \circ i = \mathrm{id}_N$

**Definition** We say that the exact sequence $0 \rightarrow N \rightarrow^i G \rightarrow^{\pi} Q \rightarrow 0$ is **right split** if there is a homomorphism $\iota: Q \rightarrow G$ such that $\pi \circ \iota = \mathrm{id}_Q$

**Definition** We say that an exact sequence is **split** if it is both left-split and right-split.

## Sequences Starting With the Same First Two Terms


**Property** Let $0 \rightarrow N \rightarrow^i G \rightarrow^{\pi_P} P \rightarrow 0$ and $0 \rightarrow N \rightarrow^i G \rightarrow^{\pi_Q} Q \rightarrow 0$ be two exact sequences. Then

1. P and Q are isomorphic
2. If one of the sequence is left split then the other is also left split
3. If one of the sequence is right split then the other is also right split

> *Proof of 1*: From the first isomorphism theorem and the surjectivity of the projection we have $P \sim G/N \sim Q$. So P and Q are isomorphic.
>
> *Proof of 2*. Let's suppose $0 \rightarrow N \rightarrow^i G \rightarrow^{\pi_P} P \rightarrow 0$ is left-split, so that there is a homorphism $j: G \rightarrow N$ such that $j \circ i = \mathrm{id}_N$. From this we deduce the second exact sequence is also left split.
>
> *Proof of 3*. Let's suppose $0 \rightarrow N \rightarrow^i G \rightarrow^{\pi_Q} Q \rightarrow 0$ is right-split, so that there is a homomorphism $\iota_Q: Q \rightarrow G$ such that $\pi_Q \circ \iota_Q = \mathrm{id}_Q$.
Let's write down $\phi: Q \rightarrow P \\ \phi = \pi_P \circ \iota_Q$ and let's show that it is an isomorphism. 
$$x \in Q, x \in \mathrm{Ker}(\phi) \implies \pi_P \circ \iota_Q(x) = e_P \implies \\
\iota_Q(x) \in \mathrm{Ker}(\pi_P) \implies \iota_Q(x) \in \mathrm{Im}(i) \implies \\ \iota_Q(x) \in \mathrm{Ker}(\pi_Q) \implies \pi_Q \circ \iota_Q(x) = e_Q \implies \\ \mathrm{id}_Q(x) = e_Q \implies x = e_Q$$ So $\phi$ is an injection.

Let's show that $\phi$ is surjective. Let $p \in P$ we want to know if there exists $q \in Q$ such that $\phi(q) = p$. Since $\pi_P$ is surjective, there exists $g \in G$ such that $\pi_P(g) = p$. What's more: 
$$\phi(q) = p \iff \pi_P \circ \iota_Q(q) = p \iff \pi_P[\iota_Q(q)] = \pi_P(g) \iff \\
\pi_P[\iota_Q(q)g^{-1}] = e_P \iff \iota_Q(q)g^{-1} \in \mathrm{Ker}(\pi_P) \iff \\
\iota_Q(q)g^{-1} \in \mathrm{Ker}(\pi_Q) \iff \pi_Q \circ [\iota_Q(q)g^{-1}] = e_G \iff \\
\pi_Q \circ [\iota_Q(q)g^{-1}] = e_G \iff \pi_Q[\iota_Q(q)]\pi_Q[g^{-1}] = e_G \iff \\
\mathrm{id}_Q(q)\pi_Q[g^{-1}] = e_G \iff q = \pi_Q[g]$$
So $\phi$ is surjective. Conclusion $\phi$ is an isomorphism.

Let's write 
$$\iota_P: P \rightarrow G \\ 
\iota_Q \circ \phi^{-1}$$
We have $\pi_P \circ \iota_P = \pi_P \circ \iota_Q \circ \phi^{-1} = \phi \circ \phi^{-1} = \mathrm{id}_P$. 
Finally we have shown that the second exact sequence is also right-split.
