## Introduction

Let $\mathcal{B} = \{0, 1 \}$ and let $F = \{f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}\}$.

The **observation group** is the group of operations that leave a beat unchanged to the observer. We model this group on a real human listener. In our case there is only one operation, and it is time shift of the beat by any increment. Any other operation, such as changing the timing, inverting the recording can be heard by a human listener. Similarly, inverting the instruments (here the 0 and the 1) is also noticeable to our ears, so it is not in the observation group.

The observation group is $\mathbb{R}$ and it acts on F via the following action 
$$\bullet: F \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow F \\ r \bullet t (x) \mapsto r(x + t) $$

To the observer, recordings that differ only by a time shift are identical and cannot be distinguished. So the observer is only interested in classes of equivalence of recordings that are shift-equivalent. Such equivalence classes are called **beats**, they are precisely the action of the observation group on F.

### Playing Group

The **playing group** is the group of operations that one can make on the recordings. There are many operations that one can do, such as shifting the recording, inverting the recording, inverting 0 and 1 (interchanging the instruments), changing the speed of the recording. There are many different playing groups according to what operations we allow.

Here we consider the playing group as all the shifting of the recording, inverting of the recording and inverting the instruments. We do not consider yet change of the recording speed. We note $\forall t \in \mathbb{R}, D_t: F \rightarrow F$, the shift operations. We write $W: F \rightarrow F \\ r \mapsto 1-r$ for the swap operation that swap the instruments. Finally, we write 
$I: F \rightarrow F \\ r(x) \mapsto r(-x)$, for the inversion operation that inverts the recording around the origin.

**Inversion around c** where $c \in \mathbb{R}$. We check that $D_c \circ I \circ D_{-c}$ is the inversion around c. 
Indeed $[D_c \circ I \circ D_{-c}] (r) (x) = r(-x+2c)$ So that $[D_c \circ I \circ D_{-c}] (r) (c) = r(c)$, so the center of inversion is preserved, and $[D_c \circ I \circ D_{-c}] (r) (c+a) = r(-(c+a)+2c) = r(c - a)$, so that we can see that points are inversed around c.

The playing group is generated by $<D_t, W, I>$. We have $W \circ D_t = D_t \circ W$ and $W \circ I = I \circ W$ so that $<D_t, I> \oplus <W>$. We also have $[I \circ D_t \circ I] (r) (x) = r(x-t) = D_{-t}$. Finally the playing group is $<D_t, I \mid ID_tI = D_{-t}> \oplus <W>$.


### Point Group


## Discrete case

$F_n = \{f: C(n) \rightarrow \mathcal{B}\}, \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$

The observation group of $F_n$ is C(n), and C(n) acts on $F_n$ via the following coaction 
$\bullet: F_n \times C(n) \rightarrow F_n \\ r \bullet g (i) \mapsto r(g + i)$

This is indeed a coaction because $r \bullet g \bullet h (i)= r(h + g + i) = r \bullet (g+h) (i)$
