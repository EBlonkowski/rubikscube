## Snowflakes

Snowflakes have symmetry. Their symmetry is interesting because it arises naturally from the simple natural phenomena. It is also very beautiful.

How to explain the symmetry?

How to explain the diversity of the patterns?

Is there any links to group theory?

It would be interesting to simulate a very simple snowflakes and trying to grow them in a simulation. The simulation might be oversimplified.

Resources about the simulation:
