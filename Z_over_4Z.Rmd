Table of the group:

| Z/4Z | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|------|---|---|---|---|
| 0    | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 1    | 1 | 2 | 3 | 0 |
| 2    | 2 | 3 | 0 | 1 |
| 3    | 3 | 0 | 1 | 2 |

Putting the subgroup {0, 2} first:

| Z/4Z | 0 | 2 | 1 | 3 |
|------|---|---|---|---|
| 0    | 0 | 2 | 1 | 3 |
| 2    | 2 | 0 | 3 | 1 |
| 1    | 1 | 3 | 2 | 0 |
| 3    | 3 | 1 | 0 | 2 |

## Automorphism group

Since Z/4Z is abelian the inner automorphism are all trivial.

Let $\phi \in \mathrm{Aut{Z/4Z}}$, $\phi$ is uniquely determined by it's image of a generator of Z/4Z, for example 1.

And we have $\phi(2) = \phi(1+1) = \phi(1) + \phi(1)$

Let $n \in \mathrm(Z), g \in \mathrm{A}$ where A is any Abelian group. We write:
$$\begin{array}{ll}
  n \cdot g = g + g + \dots + g, (\mathrm{n \times}), n > 0\\
  0 \cdot g = 0_{\mathrm{A}}\\
  n \cdot g = -g - g - \dots -g, (\mathrm{-n \times}), n < 0
  \end{array}$$

We show that $g \mapsto n \cdot g$ is a group morphism $Z \rightarrow \mathrm{A}$.

For $\phi$ to be an automorphism, it musts map generators to generators so $\phi(1) \in \{1, 3\}$.

We show that each of those define an automorphism so the automorphism group is isomorphic to Z/2Z.
