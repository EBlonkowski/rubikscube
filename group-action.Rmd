## A Set Action

In all this article **G** is a finite group and $\mathcal{S}$ is a finite set.

A set **action** is a group morphism $\phi: G \rightarrow \mathrm{Aut(S)}$.

Equivalent definition:
A set action is an application $\bullet: G \times \mathcal{S} \rightarrow S$ such that:

* $\forall x \in \mathcal{S}, e_G \bullet x = x$
* $\forall x \in \mathcal{S}, \forall g_1, g_2 \in G, g_1 g_2 \bullet x = g_1 \bullet (g_2 \bullet x)$

Proof the equivalence

1st direction: from $\phi$ construct $\bullet$

> We have $\phi: G \rightarrow \mathrm{Aut(S)}$
> We define $\forall g \in G, x \in \mathcal{S}, g \bullet x = \phi(g)(x)$
> We have $\forall x, e \bullet x = \phi(e)(x) = id(x) = x$
> $$

### Sub-actions

If H is a subgroup of G. Then H also act on S by $h \bullet_H x = h \bullet_G x$.

### Orbits

Definition

The orbits form a partition of S.

We can define the orbits for any subgroup of G.

We can define the orbits for an element g of G as being the orbits of the subgroup generated by g.

### Stabilizers

### Transitive actions

A G-action is said to be **transitive** iff it has only one orbit by G.

### Faithful actions
