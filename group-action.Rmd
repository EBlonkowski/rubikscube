## A Set Action

In all this article **G** is a finite group and $\mathcal{S}$ is a finite set.

A set **action** is a group morphism $\phi: G \rightarrow \mathrm{Aut(S)}$.

*Equivalent definition*:
A set action is an application $\bullet: G \times \mathcal{S} \rightarrow S$ such that:

* $\forall x \in \mathcal{S}, e_G \bullet x = x$
* $\forall x \in \mathcal{S}, \forall g_1, g_2 \in G, g_1 g_2 \bullet x = g_1 \bullet (g_2 \bullet x)$

Proof the equivalence

1st direction: from $\phi$ construct $\bullet$

> We have $\phi: G \rightarrow \mathrm{Aut(S)}$
> We define $\forall g \in G, x \in \mathcal{S}, g \bullet x = \phi(g)(x)$
> We have $\forall x, e \bullet x = \phi(e)(x) = id(x) = x$
> And $g_1 g_2 \bullet x = \phi(g_1 \cdot g_2)(x) = \phi(g_1) \circ \phi(g_2) (x) =\phi(g_1)(\phi(g_2)(x)) = g_1 \bullet (g_2 \bullet x)$

2nd direction: from $\bullet$ construct $\phi$

> We let $\forall g \in G, \phi(g) : x \mapsto g \bullet x$
> Let's show that \phi is a group homomorphism
> First let's show that $\phi(g_1 \cdot g_2) = \phi(g_1) \circ \phi(g_2)$
> We have $\forall x, \phi(g_1 \cdot g_2)(x) = g_1 \cdot g_2 \bullet x = g_1 \bullet g_2 \bullet x = \phi(g_1)(\phi(g_2)(x)) = \phi(g_1) \circ \phi(g_2) (x)$
> Second we have $\phi(e)(x) = e \bullet x = x$ so $\phi(e) = id$
> Finally we need just show that $\phi(g)$ is a bijection. It is indeed because
> $\phi(g \cdot g^{-1}) = \phi(g) \circ \phi(g^-1)$ and
> $\phi(g \cdot g^{-1}) = \phi(e) = id$
> And same for $\phi(g^{-1} \cdot g)$. So \phi(g) is in Aut(S)

### G-actions Morphisms

Let $\phi, \gamma$ be 2 G-actions on $\mathcal{S_1}$ and $\mathcal{S_2}$ respectively.

$f: \mathcal{S1} \rightarrow \mathcal{S2}$ is a G-action morphism iff

$\forall g \in G, \forall x \in \mathcal{S1}, f(g\bullet_{\phi}x) = g \bullet_{\gamma}f(x)$

### Sub-actions

If H is a subgroup of G. Then H also act on S by $h \bullet_H x = h \bullet_G x$.

### Orbits

**Definition**

We define $\mathrm{Orb_G(S)} = \{O \subset P(S) | \exists x \in S, O = G \bullet x\}$
Where $\forall H \subset G, H \bullet x = \{g \in H, g \bullet x\}$ where H can be any subset of H not necessarily a subgroup.
We can also write $\mathrm{Orb_G(S)} = \{G \bullet x, x \in \mathcal{S}\}$

The orbits form a partition of S.
To show that the orbits form a partition of S we need to show that:

1. Their union covers S
2. If 2 orbits are not the same then their intersection is empty.

**Proof**

1. Is clear since x is always in $G \bullet x$
2. We can show the 'contrapose'. Let $G \bullet x_1, G \bullet x_2$ such that
their intersection is not empty. Let's show that $G \bullet x_1 = G \bullet x_2$.
Let $x_0 \in G \bullet x_1 \cap G \bullet x_2$ so there exists $g_1, g_2 \in G / x_0 = g_1 \bullet x_1 = g_2 \bullet x_2$ Let x be any element of $g \bullet x_2$ let's show that x is also in $\mathrm{Orb(x_1)}$. There exists $g \in G / x = g \bullet x_2$ But according to the equation above we have $x_2 = g_2^{-1}g_1 \bullet x_1$.
So we have shown that $\mathrm{Orb(x_2)} \subset \mathrm{Orb(x_1)}}$ By symmetry we also have the opposite inclusion and the equality is proven.

**Alternative definition**

Let $\sim_G$ be the equivalence relation on S defined by $x_1 \sim_G x_2$ iff $\exists g \in G / g \bullet x_1 = x_2$

*Proof that it is an equivalence relationship*

1. Symmetry: we have $x_1 \sim_G x_2$. Let $g \in G / g \bullet x_1 = x_2$ then $ x_1 = g^{-1} \bullet x_2$ and $x_2 \sim_G x_1$.
2. $\forall x \in S, x~x$ Clearly lol
3. Transitivity. $x_1, x_2, x_3 \in S / x_1 \sim x_2, x_2 \sim x_3$
So $\exists g_1, g_2 \in G / x_1 = g_1 \bullet x_2, x_2 = g_2 \bullet x_3$ So $x_1 = g_1 \bullet g_2 \bullet x_3 = g_1 \cdot g_2 \bullet x_3 \implies x_1 \sim x_3$

We have $\forall x \in \mathcal{S}, \mathrm{Orb(x)} = C_{\sim}(x)$

**Proof**

1. $x_2 \in \mathcal{S} / x_2 \in \mathrm{Orb(x)} \implies x_2 = g \bullet x \implies x_2 \sim_G x$ so $ \mathrm{Orb(x)} \subset C_{\sim}(x)$

2. $x_2 \sim x \implies x_2 = g \bullet x \implies x_2 \in \mathrm{Orb(x)}$ and we have the second inclusion !! Win !

We can define the orbits for any subgroup of G.

We can define the orbits for an element g of G as being the orbits of the subgroup generated by g.

### Stabilizers

**Definition** Let V be any subset of S. We write $\mathrm{Stab_G(V) = \{g \in G \ g \bullet V = V\}}$

$\mathrm{Stab_G(V)$ is a subgroup of G:

1. The identity is in in the stabilizer
2. Stable by products: $g_1, g_2 \in \mathrm{Stab(V)}, g_1 \cdot g_2 \bullet V = g_1 \bullet (g_2 \bullet V) = g_2 \bullet V = V$
3. Stable by inversion $g \in \mathrm{Stab(V)}, g^{-1} \bullet V = g^{-1} \bullet (g \bullet V)$ Clearly $V \subset g^{-1} \bullet (g \bullet V)$ and since $\phi(g^{-1})$ is a bijection we have $V = g^{-1} \bullet (g \bullet V) = g^{-1} \bullet V = V$

Let $x \in \mathcal{S}$ then Stab(Orb(x)) = G since $\forall y \in Orb(x), g \bullet y \sim y \sim x \implies g \bullet y \sim x \implies g \bullet y \in Orb(x)$

### Transitive actions

A G-action is said to be **transitive** iff it has only one orbit by G.
