## A Set Action

In all this article **G** is a finite group and $\mathcal{S}$ is a finite set.

A set **action** is a group morphism $\phi: G \rightarrow \mathrm{Aut^{op}(S)}$.

*Equivalent definition*:
A set action is an application $\bullet_{op}: \mathcal{S} \times G  \rightarrow S$ such that:

* $\forall x \in \mathcal{S}, x \bullet e_G = x$
* $\forall x \in \mathcal{S}, \forall g_1, g_2 \in G, x \bullet g_1 g_2 = (x \bullet g_1) \bullet g_2$

Proof the equivalence

1st direction: from $\phi$ construct $\bullet$

> We have $\phi: G \rightarrow \mathrm{Aut^{op}(S)}$
> We define $\forall g \in G, x \in \mathcal{S}, x \bullet g = \phi(g)(x)$
> We have $\forall x, x \bullet e = \phi(e)(x) = id(x) = x$
> And $x \bullet g_1 g_2 = \phi(g_1 \cdot g_2)(x) = \phi(g_1) \circ_{op} \phi(g_2) (x) = \phi(g_2)(\phi(g_1)(x)) = (x \bullet g_1) \bullet g_2)$

2nd direction: from $\bullet$ construct $\phi$

> We let $\forall g \in G, \phi(g) : x \mapsto x \bullet g$
> Let's show that \phi is a group homomorphism
> First let's show that $\phi(g_1 \cdot g_2) = \phi(g_1) \circ_{op} \phi(g_2)$
> We have $\forall x, \phi(g_1 \cdot g_2)(x) = x \bullet g_1 \cdot g_2  = x \bullet g_1 \bullet g_2 = \phi(g_2)(\phi(g_1)(x)) = \phi(g_1) \circ_{op} \phi(g_2) (x)$
> Second we have $\phi(e)(x) = x \bullet e = x$ so $\phi(e) = id$
> Finally we need just show that $\phi(g)$ is a bijection. It is indeed because
> $\phi(g \cdot g^{-1}) = \phi(g) \circ_op \phi(g^-1)$ and
> $\phi(g \cdot g^{-1}) = \phi(e) = id$
> And same for $\phi(g^{-1} \cdot g)$. So \phi(g) is in Aut(S)

### G-actions Morphisms

Let $\phi, \gamma$ be 2 G-actions on $\mathcal{S_1}$ and $\mathcal{S_2}$ respectively.

$f: \mathcal{S1} \rightarrow \mathcal{S2}$ is a G-action morphism iff

$\forall g \in G, \forall x \in \mathcal{S1}, f(x\bullet_{\phi}g) = f(x) \bullet_{\gamma}g$

### Sub-actions

If H is a subgroup of G. Then H also act on S by $x \bullet_H h = x \bullet_G h$.

### Orbits

**Definition**

We define $\mathrm{Orb_G(S)} = \{O \subset P(S) | \exists x \in S, O = x \bullet G\}$
Where $\forall H \subset G, x \bullet H = \{x \bullet g/ g \in H \}$ where H can be any subset of H not necessarily a subgroup.


We can also write $\mathrm{Orb_G(S)} = \{x \bullet G / x \in \mathcal{S}\}$

The orbits form a partition of S.
To show that the orbits form a partition of S we need to show that:

1. Their union covers S
2. If 2 orbits are not the same then their intersection is empty.

**Proof**

1. Is clear since x is always in $x \bullet G$
2. We can show the 'contrapose'. Let $x_1 \bullet G, x_2 \bullet G$ such that
their intersection is not empty. Let's show that $x_1 \bullet G = x_2 \bullet G$.
Let $x_0 \in x_1 \bullet G \cap x_2 \bullet G$ so there exists $g_1, g_2 \in G / x_0 = x_1 \bullet g_1 = x_2 \bullet g_2$ Let x be any element of $x_2 \bullet G$ let's show that x is also in $\mathrm{Orb(x_1)}$. There exists $g \in G / x = x_2 \bullet g$ But according to the equation above we have $x_2 = x_1 \bullet g_1g_2^{-1}$ so $x = x_2 \bullet gg_1g_2^{-1}$.
So we have shown that $\mathrm{Orb(x_2)} \subset \mathrm{Orb(x_1)}$ By symmetry we also have the opposite inclusion and the equality is proven.

**Alternative definition**

Let $\sim_G$ be the equivalence relation on S defined by $x_1 \sim_G x_2$ iff $\exists g \in G / x_1 \bullet g = x_2$

*Proof that it is an equivalence relationship*

1. Symmetry: we have $x_1 \sim_G x_2$. Let $g \in G / x_1 \bullet g = x_2$ then $ x_1 = x_2 \bullet g^{-1}$ and $x_2 \sim_G x_1$.
2. $\forall x \in S, x~x$ Clearly lol
3. Transitivity. $x_1, x_2, x_3 \in S / x_1 \sim x_2, x_2 \sim x_3$
So $\exists g_1, g_2 \in G / x_1 = g_1 \bullet x_2, x_2 = g_2 \bullet x_3$ So $x_1 = g_1 \bullet g_2 \bullet x_3 = g_1 \cdot g_2 \bullet x_3 \implies x_1 \sim x_3$

We have $\forall x \in \mathcal{S}, \mathrm{Orb(x)} = C_{\sim}(x)$

**Proof**

1. $x_2 \in \mathcal{S} / x_2 \in \mathrm{Orb(x)} \implies x_2 = g \bullet x \implies x_2 \sim_G x$ so $ \mathrm{Orb(x)} \subset C_{\sim}(x)$

2. $x_2 \sim x \implies x_2 = g \bullet x \implies x_2 \in \mathrm{Orb(x)}$ and we have the second inclusion !! Win !

We can define the orbits for any subgroup of G.

We can define the orbits for an element g of G as being the orbits of the subgroup generated by g.

### Stabilizers

**Definition** Let V be any subset of S. We write $\mathrm{Stab_G(V)} = \{g \in G \ g \bullet V = V\}$

$\mathrm{Stab_G(V)}$ is a subgroup of G:

1. The identity is in in the stabilizer
2. Stable by products: $g_1, g_2 \in \mathrm{Stab(V)}, g_1 \cdot g_2 \bullet V = g_1 \bullet (g_2 \bullet V) = g_2 \bullet V = V$
3. Stable by inversion $g \in \mathrm{Stab(V)}, g^{-1} \bullet V = g^{-1} \bullet (g \bullet V)$ Clearly $V \subset g^{-1} \bullet (g \bullet V)$ and since $\phi(g^{-1})$ is a bijection we have $V = g^{-1} \bullet (g \bullet V) = g^{-1} \bullet V = V$

#### Property: Stab(Orb(x)) = G

Let $x \in \mathcal{S}$ then Stab(Orb(x)) = G since $\forall y \in Orb(x), y \bullet g \sim y \sim x \implies y \bullet g \sim x \implies y \bullet g \in Orb(x)$

#### Property: $Stab(x \bullet g) = Stab(x)^g$

$$\mathrm{Stab(x \bullet g)} = \{h \in G/ x \bullet g \bullet h = x \bullet g\} = \{h \in G/ x \bullet ghg^{-1} = x\}$$

Let $f: G \rightarrow G$ $f: h \mapsto ghg^{-1}$ f is a bijection and 
$$\{h \in G/ x \bullet ghg^{-1} = x\} = \{h \in G/ x \bullet f(h) = x\} = \{h \in G/ f(h) \in \mathrm{Stab(x)}\} = f^{-1}\{Stab(x)\} = g^{-1}\mathrm{Stab(x)}g = \mathrm{Stab(x)}^g$$

### Property: |Stab(R)|\*|Orb(R)| = |G|

Where $R \subset S$

Let G/(Stab(R)G) be the set of all classes of the form $\mathrm{Stab(R)}\cdot g$ for any g in G.

All of this classes have the same cardinal since $h \mapsto h\cdot g$ is a bijection for all g. If we can prove that the number of classes is equal to Orb(R) then since G = |Stab(R)| \* |Orb(R)|. So we want to prove that.

First let's consider the case where R has only one element x:
Let's consider the application $f: G \rightarrow Orb(x)$ given by
$$f(g) \mapsto x \bullet g$$

By definition of the orbit of x this function is surjective. Let $y \in Orb(x), \exists g_0 \in G | y = g_0 \bullet x$ Let $g \in G | f(g) = y$ then
$$f(g) = y \iff x \bullet g = x \bullet g_0 \iff x \bullet g \cdot g_0^{-1} = x \iff gg_0^{-1} \in Stab(x) \iff g \in Stab(x)g_0$$

So all the equivalence classes by f have cardinal of Stab(x) and there are |Orb(x)| classes so we have shown |Stab(x)| |Orb(x)| = |G|

### Transitive actions

A G-action is said to be **transitive** iff it has only one orbit by G.

### Faithful actions

A G-action is said to be **faithful** iff the morphism $\phi: G \rightarrow \mathrm{Aut^{op}(S)}$ is injective.
