# S3xC(2)

S3xC(2) is the direct product of the symmetric group on 3 elements by C(2), the cyclic group of order 2. S3xC(2) is a group of order 12.

Since S3 admits $<r^3, s^2, srsr>$ as a presentation
S3xC(2) admits $<r^3, s^2, i^2, srsr, is = si, ir = ri>$, where i is $(e_{S3}, 1)$

## Order of the Elements

| Elements | e | r | r2 | s | sr | sr2 | i | ir | ir2 | is | isr | isr2 |
|----------|---|---|----|---|----|-----|---|----|-----|----|-----|------|
| Order    | 1 | 3 | 3  | 2 | 2  | 2   | 2 | 6  | 6   | 2  | 2   | 2    |

## Normal Decomposition

$$0 \lhd \ <r> \ \lhd S3 \lhd S3 \times C(2)$$

# S3xC(2) as a Semi-Direct Product

Let's write $H = \{e, is\}$. H is a subgroup of S3xC(2) of order  2.
We have

1. $S3 \lhd S3 \times C(2)$
2. $S3 \cap H = \{e\}$
3. $S3 \times C(2) = S3H = HS3$

So S3xC(2) is a semi-direct product $S3 \rtimes H$, with the action of H onto S3 given by
$$isris = r^2 \ \$ \ issis = s$$
In particular the action is not trivial.
