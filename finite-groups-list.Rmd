## All groups of order 4

Let G be a group of order 4. If g has an element of order 4 then G is isomorphic to Z/4Z. Let's assume G doesn't have an element of order 4. All the elements of G must have order 1 or 2. That means all the elements of G exept the identity have order 2.
We write G = {e, a, b, c} where e is the identity and a,b and c have order 2.
$ab = ba \iff abab = e \iff (ab)^2 = e$ which is true since all elements of G have order 2. So we have shown that a and b commute. Furthermore 

* $<a> \cap <b> = {e}$ and
* ab = c because $ab=a \implies b = e$ so they generate G

Conclusion G is a direct-product $<a> \times <b> \sim (Z/2Z)^2$
